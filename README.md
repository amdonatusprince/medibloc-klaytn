# Medibloc Protocol

Medibloc is a healthFi that allows users to store their medical records and also donate blood to save a life which earns them token incentives and rewards with subsidized healthcare globally that they can redeem at any of our healthcare partners.

# Medibloc Use Cases

1. Medical Records Storage:

- Users can securely store and manage their medical records on the Medibloc platform. This provides a centralized and accessible repository for individuals to keep track of their health history, test results, and other medical information.

2. Blood Donation Incentives:

- Medibloc encourages users to donate blood by offering token incentives. This incentivizes individuals to contribute to the community's health by participating in blood donation activities. The tokens earned may have various benefits within the Medibloc ecosystem.

3. Token Rewards:

- Users receive tokens as rewards for various activities, such as blood donation or possibly other health-related behaviors. These tokens may serve as a form of loyalty points or currency within the Medibloc ecosystem.

4. Subsidized Healthcare:

- Accumulated tokens can be redeemed for subsidized healthcare services globally. This introduces a novel approach to making healthcare more affordable and accessible, potentially breaking down barriers for individuals who might face financial constraints in obtaining medical services.

5. Global Healthcare Partnerships:

- Medibloc has partnerships with healthcare providers globally. Users can redeem their earned tokens at any of these partner institutions, fostering a network that extends the reach of subsidized healthcare services.

6. Community Health Improvement:

- By promoting blood donation and incentivizing healthy behaviors, Medibloc contributes to community health improvement. The platform acts not only as a personal health data repository but also as a catalyst for positive health-related actions.

7. Data Security and Privacy:
